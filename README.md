# bitcoin-balance-checker
Tool checks balances for massive amount of addresses

You can use this tool using the two address lists generated by my other tool which is very useful: https://github.com/geniusprodigy/mega-tool-pvkmassconvert

* Create a .txt file named "list-addresses" and replace the directory sample file. Or edit the existing file with your Bitcoins Addresses, 1 per line, or use the two files generated on Output from my other tool "mega-tool-pvkmassconvert" by editing the file name for the name that the code recognizes "list-addresses".

If you prefer, you can edit the file name recognized by the code *in line 87* of the script. Edit and enter the name you want so that this file is read by the software.

* You can now run the code with: *python bitcoin-balance-checker.py*

# RESULTS

Whenever a Address with balance is found, you will hear 3 beeps of the bell sound, it is an alert that you can deactivate if you wish, just change the value True to "False" in line 21 of the source code.

Ps: The 10 most valuable (old) bitcoin addresses in history were used as an example to be checked.


The output is a file *addresses-with-balance-yay.txt*

This file contains all Bitcoin Addresses in which balance was found in the scan.

It is sorted by Address and the balance just ahead already formed in the default Bitcoin unit.
